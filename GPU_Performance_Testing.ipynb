        "PyTorch’s built-in tensor addition (`a + b`) already calls a highly optimized CUDA kernel with fully coalesced memory access and efficient launch configuration. The implementation is part of ATen’s standard elementwise operation set, which achieves near-optimal utilization without user intervention.\n",

        "\n",
        "Vector addition performs three memory transactions per element (two reads, one write). The GPU spends most of its time waiting for data rather than executing arithmetic instructions. Thus, performance scales with memory throughput, not with the number of CUDA cores. Once all memory pipelines are saturated, further optimization yields minimal gains.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5.2 Why the Numbers Are Similar\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Coalesced Access:** All implementations access memory sequentially, maximizing bus efficiency.\n",
        "2. **Sufficient Parallelism:** Launch configurations (hundreds of blocks × 256–1024 threads) fully occupy the GPU SMs.\n",
        "3. **Efficient Timing:** CUDA-event-based measurement avoids CPU–GPU synchronization noise.\n",
        "4. **Minimal Overhead:** Warm-up iterations remove one-time kernel initialization costs.\n",

        "\n",
        "The 20–25 % gap from the 320 GB/s theoretical peak arises from unavoidable architectural overheads:\n",
        "\n",
        "* L2 / L1 cache misses and memory-controller arbitration.\n",
        "* Instruction issue and warp scheduling latency.\n",

        "Repeating runs in the same runtime yields variation below ± 3 %, which is expected given dynamic clock scaling (GPU Boost) and Colab host load fluctuations.\n",

        "## 6. Recommendations for Further Exploration\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Parameter Sweeps:**\n",
        "   Test Triton with `BLOCK_SIZE` values 128–2048 or add `num_warps` tuning to study occupancy effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Datatype Experiments:**\n",
        "   Benchmark `fp16` or `bf16` variants. Smaller element size should increase effective GB/s slightly because less data is transferred per operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Larger Problem Sizes:**\n",
        "   Increase `N` to 20–80 million to ensure complete saturation of memory pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Kernel Fusion Studies:**\n",
        "   Use Triton to fuse multiple elementwise operations (e.g., add + ReLU) and measure benefits from reduced memory traffic.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Profiler Visualization:**\n",
        "   Although Nsight Systems/Compute are unavailable on Colab, exporting a `torch.profiler` trace and viewing it in [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev) provides a similar timeline view.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "The benchmark demonstrates that:\n",
        "\n",
        "* PyTorch’s native CUDA kernels already reach **near-optimal memory throughput** on modern GPUs.\n",
        "* Custom Triton kernels can match this performance with a high-level, Pythonic interface, making them ideal for research prototyping or kernel fusion.\n",
        "* Hand-written CUDA C++ code offers no measurable speed advantage for this class of operations unless specialized synchronization, shared-memory reuse, or vectorized instructions are introduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "The close agreement between all three methods validates both Triton’s compiler quality and PyTorch’s backend optimizations. For element-wise, bandwidth-limited tasks, the performance ceiling is set by the hardware, not by the programming framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, achieving **~248 GB/s** on a Tesla T4 corresponds to roughly **77 % of theoretical peak bandwidth**, which is an excellent result in practical GPU conditions. These findings confirm that high-level GPU programming frameworks can deliver production-grade performance without sacrificing usability.\n"
